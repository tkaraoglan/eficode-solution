# Weatherapp

This is my Cloud(AWS)solution of Eficode code challange.

## Prerequisites

    An openweathermap API key.
    AWS Account

### My Solution

This solution is for eficode+ folder, you can follow the same instructions for eficode folder.

    first we clone folder from Github.

```
git clone https://github.com/tkaraoglan/eficode-solution.git
```

    secondly , change directory to eficode folder;
    
```
cd eficode-solution/docker-solutions/eficode+/
```

    now you should see cloudformation.yml file in this folder, we will use this file a little bit later.
