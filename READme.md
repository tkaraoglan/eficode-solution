# Weatherapp

This is my solution of Eficode code challange.

## Prerequisites

* An [openweathermap](http://openweathermap.org/) API key.
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed.
* AWS Account && [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html)
* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) installed.

## My Solution(s)

As a beginning, Cloud, Docker-"DockerCompose," and ansible are the three aspects of my solutions. 

Each solution has two options: the first is to use the repository that eficode provides directly, and the second is to use a customized version. 

In the first solution you should see a picture as follows; 

and in the second solution you shoul see a detailed one;


## Important Note

Every solution directory has its own Readme file.
